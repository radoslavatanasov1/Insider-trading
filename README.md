# ðŸ“Š Insider Data Scraper and Visualization Panel

This project scrapes insider transaction data from [Dataroma](https://www.dataroma.com) and stores it in MongoDB. It also provides a Flask web application to visualize and filter the data.

Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Use the date filter to view transactions within a specific range.

```bash
Enter the start page number (1-2103): 1
Enter the end page number (1-2103): 10
```
